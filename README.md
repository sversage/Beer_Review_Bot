# Beer_Review_Bot

Using Beautiful Soup I collected various beer reviews from Two Beer Dudes and subsequently run those reviews through a Markov Chain to generate a new review. 

Recently I created a Twitter account for those reviews to post to, throughout the day I decrease the length of the Markon chain gradually from 4 to 1, giving the effect of slightly more non-sensical reviews as the Twitter bot drinks more.
