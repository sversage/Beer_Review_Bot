#The Motivation

This twitter bot was an idea based upon a micro brewery recommendation project I was working on, as a result of that project I collected various beer reviews from Two Beer Dudes that were over the top and a bit humerous. I decided it would be fun to create a bot, that would generate it's own reviews based using Markov Chains.

Throughout the day the Markov Chain will get shorter, causing the reviews to be less and less sensical after he reviews a beer on the hour.
